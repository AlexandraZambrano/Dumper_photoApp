# ``DUMPER ðŸ“¸!!!``

This is an app made to manage your pictures and dump them into an amazing community!

Here, you'll be able to see others' pics as well as them can see yours, so let's make a common photo dump.

In this app you'll be able to upload, update, delete and see your pictures.
## ``Tools``
1. To upload the images we use a cloud service called backblaze b2
2. To store data we've used MongoDB Atlas
3. To build the frontend we've used React and Vite
4. To build the backend we've used Node and express.js
## ``Prerequisites``

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
## ``Installation``

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexandraZambrano/Dumper_photoApp.git

## ``Backend``
- To start the app you need to first run a 
   ```bash
      npm install
- Then you need to run a 
   ```bash
      nodemon
And it should start running right away, make sure that it is connected to the data base.
## ``Frontend``
- To start the app you need to first run a 
   ```bash
      npm install
- Then you need to run a 
   ```bash
      npm run dev
And it should start running right away.
